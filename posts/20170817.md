## South Asian languages on Wikidata

The accessibility of the data on a site such as this relies heavily on appropriate localization. I have managed to get the number of Wikidata items with Bengali labels to ~650,000, but this is still a very small amount. There is not nearly as big an effort to increase this for even Hindi, let alone other South Asian languages.
