## Welcome to this site!

This is the home page for Mahir Morshed.

I am presently a senior in computer engineering (minoring in linguistics) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am particularly interested in speech processing as it pertains to waveform encoding methods and the derivation of articulatory features from the speech signal.

I also spend quite a bit of time contributing to Wikimedia wikis.
