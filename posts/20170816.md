## Welcome to my homepage!

This site, which may be hosted on GitHub or on a server connected to the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign, will continue to be under construction, but I intend to make sure that it is updated, at least in content if not in styling, as frequently as possible. Apologies for the lack of other working links, but find info about myself (including links to GitHub and LinkedIn) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mahir256).
