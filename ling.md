I have grown up speaking Bengali and learned Spanish in high school and by myself since then; as such I am comfortable regarding Bengali as a native language and Spanish as a language in which I am proficient but not necessarily fluent.

My work on Wikimedia projects has helped me maintain my ability to produce and understand these languages. It has also forced me to reckon with numerous other languages semi-regularly in the course of fulfilling my responsibilities on those projects.
